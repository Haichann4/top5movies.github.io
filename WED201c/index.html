            <p>The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American drama film written and directed by Frank Darabont, based on

                fellow prisoner, contraband smuggler Ellis "Red" Redding (Morgan Freeman), and becomes instrumental in a
                money-laundering operation led by the prison warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton). William Sadler, Clancy

            <img src="images/godfather.jpg" alt="Movie poster for The Godfather">
            <p>The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola who co-wrote the screenplay
                with Mario Puzo, based on Puzo's best-selling 1969 novel of the same name. The film stars Marlon Brando,
                Al Pacino, James Caan, Richard S. Castellano, Robert Duvall, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard
                Conte, and Diane Keaton. It is the first installment in The Godfather trilogy. The story, spanning 1945
                to 1955, chronicles the Corleone family under patriarch Vito Corleone (Brando), focusing on the
                transformation of his youngest son, Michael Corleone (Pacino), from reluctant family outsider to
                ruthless mafia boss.</p>

            <h2>Movie 3</h2>
            <img src="images/darkknight.jpg" alt="Movie poster for The Dark Knight">
            <p>The Dark Knight is a trilogy of DC Comics superhero Batman films directed by Christopher Nolan. In 1997,
                Warner Bros. had completely failed with a film based on this theme called Batman & Robin. Therefore, the
                company decided to revive the film series with a darker script in 2005 with Batman Begins, directed by
                Nolan and starring Christian Bale. Batman Begins was highly appreciated by critics and had certain
                commercial successes, which was the main motivation for Warner Bros. to release two sequels, The Dark
                Knight in 2008 and The Dark Knight Rises in 2012, with Nolan continuing to direct and Bale still playing
                the lead role. The latter two parts were a huge success and earned nearly $2.1 billion worldwide. The
                Dark Knight series is highly regarded by critics, nominated for many important awards and considered one
                of the best film series of all time.</p>

            <h2>Movie 4</h2>
            <img src="images/godfather2.jpg" alt="Movie poster for Goodfellas">
            <p>Goodfellas is a 1990 American crime film directed by Martin Scorsese, produced by Irwin Winkler and
                distributed by Warner Bros. It is an adaptation of the 1985 non-fiction book Wiseguy by Nicholas
                Pileggi, who co-wrote the screenplay with Scorsese. The film stars Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, Joe
                Pesci, Lorraine Bracco and Paul Sorvino. It is the first film in the trilogy of crime films directed by
                Scorsese, followed by Casino and The Irishman. The film narrates the rise and fall of mob associate
                Henry Hill and his friends and family from 1955 to 1980. Goodfellas is widely regarded as one of the
                greatest films in the crime genre, and is considered one of the best films of the 1990s. In 2000, it was
                deemed "culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant" and selected for preservation in the
                National Film Registry by the United States Library of Congress. Its content and style have been
                emulated in numerous other films and television shows.</p>

            <h2>Movie 5</h2>
            <img src="images/12angrymen.jpg" alt="Movie poster for Pulp Fiction">
            <p>12 Angry Men is a 1957 American legal drama film directed by Sidney Lumet in his feature directorial
                debut, adapted by Reginald Rose from his 1954 teleplay. A critique of the American jury system during
                the McCarthy Era, the film tells the story of a jury of twelve men as they deliberate the conviction or
                acquittal of a teenager charged with murder on the basis of reasonable doubt; disagreement and conflict
                among the jurors forces them to question their morals and values. It stars an ensemble cast, featuring
                Henry Fonda (who also produced the film with Rose), Lee J. Cobb, Ed Begley, E. G. Marshall, Jack Warden,
                Martin Balsam, John Fiedler, and Jack Klugman.</p>
